Bug Number: 789
single point simulations in ccsm_seq mode run 2.5X slower than in offline mode

I ran a 9 year single point simulation in offline mode and one in ccsm_seq
mode.  Jobs were both submitted to bluevista regular queue.  The ccsm_seq
simulation took about 2.5X longer than the offline one.  It appears most of the
extra time is spent in the datm.  Here are some timing results:

Offline:
runtotal   1201s

Ccsm_seq:
DRIVER_RUN_LOOP   3063s
  DRIVER_LND_RUN  1184s
  DRIVER_ATM_RUN  1817s

In the log file more timing results:

datm_phys_dataIn - everything   1614s
datm_phys_dataIn - read data    1584s

So it seems like the datm routines that read in data are taking up more time
than the model itself.

Problem with lt_archiving for too-many files

Keith has been running into a bunch of problems with the lt_archiving when
using CLM. He can get 30 years in a 6 hour wall-clock cycle -- which means
overa thousand files -- where lt_archive.sh pukes.

Making it robust -- regardless of the number of files would be one first step.
The next problem he has is that running over just 10 years -- the job resubmits
itself before the lt_archive script is done. Then the scripts conflict and he
ends up having to run the archiving by hand. It would also help if it were
easier to submit the lt_archive.sh script as well.

Bug Number: 452
Problem with support of number of soil-colors NOT equal to 8 or 20

The mksurfdata tools file mksoicol.F90 sets nsoicol to the max value found in
the input soilcolor file:
  nsoicol = maxval(soil_color_i)  

However, the code will fail if  nsoicol does not equal 20 or 8 (which it might
in paleo cases).  perhaps the code should be extended to handle a case where
nsoicol is not 20 or 8.

Bug Number: 361
Problem with exact restarts on SGI

Restarts do NOT work correctly and do NOT give exact answers as a simulation that runs continusly.

These are the list of tests from test/system/test_driver.sh that fail, because of
this. TER tests are exact restart tests and TBR tests are branch tests -- testing
that answers are exact when namelist items remain unchanged.

Problem running on Cray-X1

Offline CLM will NOT run on Cray-X1 because of calls to shr_sys_flush(6) without
unit 6 being explicitly opened.

Bug number: 652
Output different for different number of threads PGF90 

PGI Version 6.1.6, and NetCDF Version 3.6.2. Works on other platforms/compilers and
also works with PGI-7.0-7.

clm-offline-tools: interpinic does NOT work for DGVM

interpinic does NOT work for DGVM. OK as CNDV will replace DGVM.
