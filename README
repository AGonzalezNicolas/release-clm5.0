Community Land Surface Model (CLM) version 4.0 -- source code, tools, 
offline-build and test scripts. This gives you everything you need
to run CLM with CESM with datm8 to provide NCEP forcing data in 
place of a modeled atmosphere.

What is new in this version of CLM (compared to the CCSM4.0 release)?

See the Users-Guide for a description of the changes since the
CCSM4.0 release.

What is new in CLM4 (compared to CLM3.5.00)?

See the ChangeLog file for a summary description of the most recent major
version changes leading up to clm4_0_00, and then from CLM4.0.00 to now.
The User's Guide also has a section on this as well.
