1.) Start at the top level directory of your sandbox

  cd $clm_root

2.) Update JUST the top level directory with the externals.

  svn update --depth immediates

3.) Move any local changes you have under clm
    (This preserves any local changes you have in your sandbox, as well as changes on your branch)

  svn mv models/lnd/clm/ components/clm

4.) Move any local changes you have under scripts to save your cases
    (if you don't have cases to save under scripts, you don't have
     to do this step)

  svn mkdir --parents cime/scripts
  mv scripts cime/scripts/

5.) Bring in updated externals and updates to clm source files

  svn update

6.) Mark changes to models directory as resolved

  svn resolved models

7.) Commit these changes to your branch
