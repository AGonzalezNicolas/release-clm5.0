       DefaultDATM_IN_Namelist.xml                        Jun/08/2007

       Values to use by default for creation of datm7 namelists
       when running in CLM-only mode with sequential-CCSM.
       The element names are the same as the corresponding namelist
       variables.  Values that depend on the model configuration use
       attributes to express the dependency.  The recognized attributes
       are: RESOLUTION, mask, ic_ymd, ic_tod, sim_year and all configuration
       attributes from the config_cache.xml file (with keys converted to upper-case).
