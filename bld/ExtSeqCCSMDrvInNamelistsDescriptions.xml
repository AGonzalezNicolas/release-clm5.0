	Descriptions of the component namelists for external sequential CCSM.
	Element names are for the appropriate namelist, and attributes are
	the namelist items in the given namelist. Element names give the
	type of value they contain:
		"s" = string
		"i" = integer
		"r" = floating point
		"l" = logical
        Any leftover namelist items will cause an error.
