### How to contribute:

It's recommended that you first contact ctsm-software@ucar.edu with the changes you propose.
Work with them to think about the design and implemention of the changes as well as the planning
and scheduling for the change to come into CTSM.

It's also recommened that you join the ctsm-core@ucar.edu ctsm-dev@ucar.edu google groups in order 
to be informed about the science that is happening in CTSM as well as the latest develepments and tags.
The ctsm-dev group is here:

https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/forum/#!forum/ctsm-dev

Use the help from the WIKI below to setup a fork and personal branch in github to put your developments
on and keep up to date with the main development CTSM. Once the changes are sufficiently advanced you
can form a Pull Request on github under

https://github.com/ESCOMP/ctsm/pulls

To show your proposed changes and start getting feedback on your code changes. This also allows your
changes to be planned for and slated for a time to come into CTSM master. In most cases you won't merge
the Pull Request yourself, but a software engineer responsible for CTSM will do additional testing and
bring the changes to CTSM master.
