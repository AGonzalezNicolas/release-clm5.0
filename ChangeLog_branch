One-line Summary: If using VIC, don't use the TOPModel formulation for SurfaceRunoff ever

Purpose of changes
------------------

The code was using the TOPModel-based formulation for SurfaceRunoff if
frost_table > zwt_perched. Sean Swenson felt this shouldn't be done, and
refactoring will be easier if VIC always uses the vic-looking formulation, so
I'm stopping applying this formulation when using VIC.


Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

CLM testing:

 [PASS means all tests PASS and OK means tests PASS other than expected fails.]

  build-namelist tests:

    yellowstone - not run

  unit-tests (components/clm/src):

    yellowstone - not run

  tools-tests (components/clm/test/tools):

    yellowstone - not run

  PTCLM testing (components/clm/tools/shared/PTCLM/test):

     yellowstone - not run

  regular tests (aux_clm):

    yellowstone_intel - just ran vic tests
    yellowstone_pgi - just ran vic tests
    yellowstone_gnu - not run
    cheyenne_intel - just ran vic tests
    hobart_nag - not run
    hobart_pgi - not run
    hobart_intel - not run

  Just ran the following vic tests (all of the vic tests in the test list):

      ERP_D_Ld5.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.yellowstone_intel.clm-vrtlay
      ERP_Ld5.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.yellowstone_pgi.clm-vrtlay
      ERP_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50Vic.yellowstone_intel.clm-vrtlay
      ERP_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50Vic.yellowstone_pgi.clm-decStart
      SMS_Ld1.f19_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.yellowstone_intel.clm-default
      ERP_D_Ld5.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.cheyenne_intel.clm-vrtlay
      ERP_D_Ld5.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50Vic.cheyenne_intel.clm-vrtlay
      SMS_Ld1.f19_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.cheyenne_intel.clm-default

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm4_5_16_r249

    For baseline comparisons, just spot-checked one test:
    ERP_D_Ld5.f09_g17.I2000Clm50Vic.cheyenne_intel.clm-vrtlay

    This test changed answers

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline:

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: Vic configurations
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      larger than roundoff; not investigated closely

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A
