clm/tools/mkgriddata/README		May/12/2007

The files in this directory enable a user to create
a regular regional or global grid and associated 
land fraction and land mask given a high resolution
input topographic dataset. 

0) Untar your input data in some directory

1) cd to this directory 

2) run gmake

3) create namelist file (default mkgriddata.namelist).
   must specify settings for either

      mksrf_fnavyoro    - high resolution topo dataset        
      mksrf_lsmlon      - number of longitudes
      mksrf_lsmlat      - number of latitudes
      mksrf_edgen       - northern edge of grid (degrees)
      mksrf_edgee       - eastern edge of grid (degrees)
      mksrf_edges       - southern edge of grid (degrees)
      mksrf_edgew       - western edge of grid (degrees)
   or
      mksrf_fcamfile    - cam topo file
   or 
      mksrf_fccsmdom    - ccsm domain file
   or
      mksrf_fclmgrid    - clm grid or surface dataset file

   make sure datasets in namelist files point to where you
   have untarred your input data.

4) run code (e.g.):
   mkgriddata < mkgrdidata.namelist >&! mkgriddata.out

5) move (and rename if appropriate) generated  grid dataset
  (e.g. to /fis/cgd/csm/inputdata/clm/griddata)


Notes:

1. File naming conventions need explanation.  An input file from 1.9x2.5 will
produce an output file of 096x144.  The output griddata file must be renamed to
the FV naming convention (1.9x2.5) when it is archived under /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm2/griddata/.

e.g., cp surfdata_096x144.nc /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm2/surfdata/surfdata_1.9x2.5_061130.nc

2.  Grid files should have LATIXY of 90 at the poles.  The displaced pole (89.*) should not appear in
FV grid files, although 90+/-0.25 is used for mapping and domain files.  FV Grid files with something other
than 90 at the poles are incorrect and should not be used.
