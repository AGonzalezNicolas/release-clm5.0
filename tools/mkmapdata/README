The routines in this directory create a mapping dataset from
SCRIP grid files to map from one grid to another. These mapping files
are used by either CLM or mksurfdata_map to regrid from one resolution
to another.

The script uses ESMF and requires that ESMF be built and the path
for ESMF binary files (using the program ESMF_RegridWeightGen) 
be given as input to the script.

Currently uses: ESMF5.2.0

The following steps provide a method to create the executable
and generate the grid map dataset:

0) Background tasks you only have to do once

 a.)  export your input data

 b.) Obtain and build a version of ESMF compatible with this script

The version needs to support ESMF_RegridWeightGen and support the
options passed to it in the mkmapdata.sh script.

1) cd to this directory 

2) run script(e.g.): (see header of mkmapdata.sh for other environment that can be set)
        mkmapdata.sh -i -r 10x15

3) move (and rename if appropriate) generated map dataset
   to /fis/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm/mappingdata/maps, etc.

4.) Alturnatively, run regridbatch.sh to run mkmapdata.sh for a bunch of 
    different resolutions.

Important files:

  regridbatch.sh ------- Script to run mkmapdata.sh for many resolutions
  mvNimport.sh --------- Script to copy and import mapping files in for many resolutions
  mkmapdata.sh --------- Script to create mapping datasets for a given resolution
