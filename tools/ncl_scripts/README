CLM NCL script tools for analysis of CLM history files -- or for creation or
modification of CLM input files.

In order to make these scripts work in the testing framework the following must
be done.

1.) Respond to CSMDATA and CLM_ROOT as needed.
2.) Print a line with "success" after the work is completed.
	
Scripts available:

getregional_datasets.pl ----- Extract out regional datasets from global ones put files in location can be used by build-namelist.
addgrid2spointurban.ncl ----- Add grid data to urban point datafiles.
clmi_increasesoillayer.ncl -- Increate soil layer for clm Initial Condition files from 10 to 15.
convertUrbanOffline2Seq.ncl - Convert urban offline data to ccsm sequential mode that can be used by datm7.
pftdyntest2raw.ncl ---------- Convert pftdyn test datasets to rawdata format so can be used to create future datasets.
aerdepregrid.ncl ------------ Regrid the Aerosol deposition dataset to a different
resolution.
                              Uses bi-linear interpolation.
ndepregrid.ncl -------------- Regrid the Nitrogen deposition datasets to a different resolution.
