One-line Summary: Two fixes for init_interp

Purpose of changes
------------------

Two fixes for init_interp:

(1) Copy as many snow layers as possible in init_interp

    In most cases, we only need data from the existing snow layers. But in a
    few cases - in particular, the flx_abs* variables - we need data even
    from non-existing snow layers in order for interpolation to be
    bit-for-bit. The change here reworks snow interpolation so that, in
    addition to copying the existing snow layers, we also copy as many
    non-existing snow layers as will fit in the destination layer structure.

    Fixes #326

(2) For glcmec, match col/patch types in some cases

    If glcmec used the same elevation class definitions in input and output,
    then match classes as we do for most landunit types, rather than just
    using topographic heights. (An exception is output cells with the
    single_at_atm_topo behavior, because their types could change once we
    enter the run loop.)

    Fixes #325


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #):
- #326: init_interp can change answers for absorbed radiation in
  non-existent snow layers
- #325: init_interp can change answers over the CISM domain

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm5.0.dev004


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: all configurations with use_init_interp = .true.
    - what platforms/compilers: all
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      Not investigated carefully, but expected to be larger than roundoff / same climate

      Differences arise due to both fixes listed above.

      (1) Copy as many snow layers as possible in init_interp: It
          appears that this only changes answers for some radiation
          terms in the first time step after initialization when a snow
          layer had just melted before the restart file was written. In
          this case, the flx_abs* variables are set differently for this
          just-disappeared layer. This can affect a lot of grid cells,
          but I expect differences from this change to be very small and
          not scientifically important.

      (2) For glcmec, match col/patch types in some cases: This seems to
          only affect a small number of grid cells in Greenland. So I do
          not expect the overall effect on a simulation to be significant.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: List of important bug fixes

Purpose of changes
------------------

A list of important bug and usability fixes. One of those changes makes it easier for the user to end up with
initial condition files that don't match the start date of their simulation. This is problematic because of the 
saved counters for prognostic crop. For sure a mismatched date will end up with bad results for the first season,
but this will also affect subsequent years running averages. So we don't recommend that you do that.

Jim Edwards also brought in some changes for PIO for 64bit_data, and to fix fill values for integer data. And we updated
manage_externals to the newest version.


Bugs fixed or introduced
------------------------

Issues fixed (include CTSM Issue #): [If none, remove this line]
#213 -- usability issue for CPLHIST that Keith found.
#210 -- Recent request to increase number of tapes to 10.
#169 -- usability issue for running hybrid or branch cases with crop that keeps biting Mike Mills.
#68 --- workaround for gnu compiler bug
#46 --- needed for multi-instance
#66 --– need to relax tolerance for negative C/N values in order for CLM45 Crop to work
#65 --– need to change a check from "> 0" to "> [small val]"
#240 -- from Jim
#255 -- get PTCLM working
#253 -- bad clm40 IC file

Known bugs introduced in this tag (include github issue ID):
 #329 -- init_interp doesn't work if finidat points to finidat_interp_dest from a different case
 #326 -- init_interp can change answers for absorbed radiation in non-existent snow layers
 #325 -- init_interp can change answers over the CISM domain

Notes of particular relevance for users
---------------------------------------

Caveats for users (e.g., need to interpolate initial conditions):
   You can bypass the ignore_ic_date error when crop is being used
   Matching for initial conditions for crop simulations are allowed to ignore the month/day
   When crop is on and the start date doesn't match the date for the initial conditions file,
   the counters for the crop model will be incorrect -- and hence the first season will be screwed
   up, and the screwed up results will affect the running averages for the future. This was a condition
   that we didn't allow you to easily do -- we've made it easier for this to happen now.

Changes to CLM's user interface (e.g., new/renamed XML or namelist variables):
   Allow ten streams of history tapes rather than just six.
   Correct the I1850Clm50BgcSpinup compset
   You can bypass the ignore_ic_date error when crop is being used (may affect results)
   Matching for initial conditions for crop simulations are allowed to ignore the month/day
   The precision control settings for Nitrogen and Carbon are now making it to the namelist

Changes made to namelist defaults (e.g., changed parameter values): ncrit=1.d-8 (10X looser)

Changes to the datasets (e.g., parameter, surface or initial files): Correct to a few finidat files (clm4_0_CRUv7)

Substantial timing or memory changes: Maybe 3% to memory

 There is a 3% increase to memory, but memory high water mark seems to double

Notes of particular relevance for developers: (including Code reviews and testing)
---------------------------------------------

Caveats for developers (e.g., code that is duplicated that requires double maintenance):

   Add edison to fates testlist

Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES - just in SNOWICE, SNOWLIQ

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      - just changes the diagnostic fields SNOWICE, SNOWLIQ, due to
        fixed c2l_scale_type for these fields


      The test
      ERP_P72x2_Ly3.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-irrig_o3_reduceOutput
      also showed small answer changes just in the cpl field
      l2x_Sl_tsrf00, for a single grid cell in Antarctica
      (221.485144932008 vs. 221.485144910486). However, I reran it 10
      times, and it was bit-for-bit (other than SNOWICE and SNOWLIQ) in
      all 10 of those re-runs. So I'm chalking this up to a machine
      fluke. (The restart file from the problematic run showed diffs in
      a bunch of fields; from spot-checking one - SNOW_DEPTH - diffs
      were just in one point. But since this is a reduceOutput run,
      diffs didn't show up in CLM history files. I confirmed that there
      were no diffs in finidat_interp_dest or in namelists.) I
      regenerated baselines for this test using one of the cases without
      this machine fluke.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

One-line Summary: Initial version of CLM5.0

This is the initial science version of CLM5.0.

Developments for CLM5.0 build on the progress made in CLM4.5. Most major components of the model have been updated with particularly
notable changes made to soil and plant hydrology, snow density, river modeling, carbon and nitrogen cycling and coupling, and crop
modeling.
The updates to CLM science are documented here:

https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Introduction/CLM50_Tech_Note_Introduction.html#clm5-0

This version has production versions of CLM5.0 CMIP6 land-use change files for 1850, historical, and 2000. It has preliminary
versions of CMIP6 forcing files for Nitrogen deposition and population density. Further updates are needed for prescribed aerosols,
and future scenarios.

Spunup initial conditions are provided for several CLM physics and forcing combinations from simulations run at 1-degree resolution
(fv 0.9x1.25 with g1xv6 ocean mask).
