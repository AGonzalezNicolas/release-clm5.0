One-line Summary: Add some land ice diagnostic vars needed for CMIP6

Purpose of changes
------------------

Add some diagnostic variables needed for analyzing land ice that have
been requested by some of the MIPs in CMIP6 (especially ISMIP).

Also, fixes c2l_scale_type to fix urban scaling for SNOWICE, SNOWLIQ

Some changes from Leo van Kampenhout.

CLM tag used for the baseline comparisons: clm5.0.dev001


Answer changes
--------------

Changes answers relative to baseline: YES - just in SNOWICE, SNOWLIQ

  If a tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
  following should be filled in (otherwise remove this section):

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations: All
    - what platforms/compilers: All
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 
      - just changes the diagnostic fields SNOWICE, SNOWLIQ, due to
        fixed c2l_scale_type for these fields


      The test
      ERP_P72x2_Ly3.f10_f10_musgs.I2000Clm50BgcCrop.cheyenne_intel.clm-irrig_o3_reduceOutput
      also showed small answer changes just in the cpl field
      l2x_Sl_tsrf00, for a single grid cell in Antarctica
      (221.485144932008 vs. 221.485144910486). However, I reran it 10
      times, and it was bit-for-bit (other than SNOWICE and SNOWLIQ) in
      all 10 of those re-runs. So I'm chalking this up to a machine
      fluke. (The restart file from the problematic run showed diffs in
      a bunch of fields; from spot-checking one - SNOW_DEPTH - diffs
      were just in one point. But since this is a reduceOutput run,
      diffs didn't show up in CLM history files. I confirmed that there
      were no diffs in finidat_interp_dest or in namelists.) I
      regenerated baselines for this test using one of the cases without
      this machine fluke.

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff? N/A

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate (put details of the simulations in the experiment database)
       - casename: N/A

   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate: N/A

One-line Summary: Initial version of CLM5.0

This is the initial science version of CLM5.0.

Developments for CLM5.0 build on the progress made in CLM4.5. Most major components of the model have been updated with particularly
notable changes made to soil and plant hydrology, snow density, river modeling, carbon and nitrogen cycling and coupling, and crop
modeling.
The updates to CLM science are documented here:

https://escomp.github.io/ctsm-docs/doc/build/html/tech_note/Introduction/CLM50_Tech_Note_Introduction.html#clm5-0

This version has production versions of CLM5.0 CMIP6 land-use change files for 1850, historical, and 2000. It has preliminary
versions of CMIP6 forcing files for Nitrogen deposition and population density. Further updates are needed for prescribed aerosols,
and future scenarios.

Spunup initial conditions are provided for several CLM physics and forcing combinations from simulations run at 1-degree resolution
(fv 0.9x1.25 with g1xv6 ocean mask).
