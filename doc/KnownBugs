Bug Number: 452
Problem with support of number of soil-colors NOT equal to 8 or 20

The mksurfdata tools file mksoicol.F90 sets nsoicol to the max value found in
the input soilcolor file:
  nsoicol = maxval(soil_color_i)  

However, the code will fail if  nsoicol does not equal 20 or 8 (which it might
in paleo cases).  perhaps the code should be extended to handle a case where
nsoicol is not 20 or 8.

Bug Number: 361
Problem with exact restarts on SGI

Restarts do NOT work correctly and do NOT give exact answers as a simulation that runs continusly.

These are the list of tests from test/system/test_driver.sh that fail, because of
this. TER tests are exact restart tests and TBR tests are branch tests -- testing
that answers are exact when namelist items remain unchanged.

Bug Number: 449
Problem with create_crop_landunit

As reported to me by Bill Sacks at UW-Madison:
The crop(:) array in pftvarcon needs to be initialized before surfrd is called
for create_crop_landunit to work properly, but crop(:) is set in pftconrd,
which is called after surfrd. Thus, surfrd sees a crop(:) array that is set to
0 for all PFTs, and so it doesn't put anything on the crop landunit. I have
done a simple work-around to solve this problem, making crop(:) a parameter,
and thus initializing it at compile-time.

Bug Number: 448
Problem compiling on Darwin with XLF compilers:

There's a problem running the Dependency generator on Darwin OS X 10.4.9 using
XLF compilers.
This is with cam and clm for clm3_expa_98 and as of cam3.4.10.

The file assert.H is mistakenly matched from mct/mpeu so that there is an
explcit dependence on assert.h for gptl.c.

You can get around this problem by editing Depends by hand and removing that
dependence. Or you can modify mkDepends to explicitly remove this file when
creating Depends.

Bug Number: 402
Leap-year calendar does NOT work:

If you try to turn on a GREGORIAN calander in your namelist -- it will NOT
work. You can get around this by modifying code to turn off the NO_LEAP_CALENDAR
or by linking with the full version of ESMF rather than the wrf time-manager
implimentation.

====================================================================================
Bug number: 421
newcprnc can NOT be used to compare restart or initial-condition (IC) files:

Because restart and IC files do NOT contain a time-dimension the utility
newcprnc can NOT be used to compare them.

Bug number: 447
Problem running on Cray-X1

Offline CLM will NOT run on Cray-X1 because of calls to shr_sys_flush(6) without
unit 6 being explicitly opened.

Bug number: 366
RTM log error checks:

Some of the clm-rtm mapping checks are obsolete, so new checks need to be
implemented (per T. Craig). One example is:

Attempting to initialize RTM
Columns in RTM = 720
Rows in RTM = 360
read river direction data
MAP_SETMAPSAR warning: masks/areas not conserved
global sum output area = 0.5100996991E+09
global sum input area =  0.2071386276E+09

Bug number: 251
Potential floating point errors in src/biogeophys/SurfaceAlbedoMod.F90:

There is the potential for a floating point error to occur in TwoStream.F90 due
to taking the exponential of a large number. 
          s1 = exp(-h*vai(p))
          s2 = exp(-twostext(p)*vai(p))
A fix has been implemented by P. Thornton but the fix is encased in a CN cpp. 
This fix should probably be implemented universally in the code but tested to
determine if there are any non-bfb changes in non-CN mode.

This is in SurfaceAlbedoMod.F90 in biogeophys

#if (defined CN)          
          ! PET, 3/1/04: added this test to avoid floating point errors in
exp()
          t1 = min(h*vai(p), 40._r8)
          s1 = exp(-t1)
          t1 = min(twostext(p)*vai(p), 40._r8)
          s2 = exp(-t1)
#else
          s1 = exp(-h*vai(p))
          s2 = exp(-twostext(p)*vai(p))
#endif
