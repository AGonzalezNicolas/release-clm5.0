CLM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if applicable:

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in:

  Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
    - what code configurations:
    - what platforms/compilers:
    - nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff/same climate; new climate): 

   If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
   than roundoff?

   If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
   climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
   - source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
   - platform/compilers:
   - configuration (CPP ifdefs):
   - build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
   - MSS location of output:

   MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:
   
   URL for LMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
