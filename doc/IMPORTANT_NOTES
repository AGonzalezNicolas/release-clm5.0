Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:

   C13 		(-c13)
       The C13 mode for bgc=cn is NOT scientifically validated or documented and NOT recommended to be used.

   SNICAR_FRC 	(-snicar_frc)
       This mode is tested and functional, but is NOT constantly scientifcally validated, and should be 
       considered experimental.

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

  suplnitro='ALL'        (suplnitro='ALL' with -bgc cn)
                         The suplemental Nitrogen mode of the CN model is known 
                         to be too productive.
  urban_traffic:         Not currently functional

See KnownBugs/KnownLimitations files for Known Problems:

    See the KnownBugs file in this directory for the list of known problems. We expect
    that eventually we will fix the bugs in this list. In the KnownLimitations file
    we list limitations in the code that we have workarounds for that we do NOT expect
    to fix.
