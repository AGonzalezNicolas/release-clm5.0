Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:

   C13 		(-c13)
       The C13 mode for bgc=cn is NOT scientifically validated or documented and NOT recommended to be used.

   CASA 	(-bgc casa)
       The bgc=casa mode is NOT scientifically validated or documented and NOT recommended to be used.

   BUILDPIO  	(-pio)
       This mode is NOT tested and not even functional and hence should NOT be used. PIO WILL be provided
       in future versions however.

   SNICAR_FRC 	(-snicar_frc)
       This mode is tested and functional, but is NOT constantly scientifcally validated, and should be 
       considered experimental.

build-namelist items that are NOT recommended:

-lnd_res 

This is the option to turn on the fine-mesh mode of CLM, running CLM at a finer
resolution than the atmospheric forcing. This is an experimental mode and NOT recommend
for general use. You turn this on by 

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

  create_crop_landunit:  Functional, but experimental
  carbon_only:           (carbon_only=.true. with -bgc cn)
                         The Carbon only mode of CN model is known to be too productive, and requires some modifications 
                         that will be on an update to the CESM1.0 release.
  urban_traffic:         Not currently functional
  pio namelist options:  hist_pioflag, ncd_lowmem2d, ncd_pio_def, ncd_pio_UseRearranger, ncd_pio_UseBoxRearr, 
                         ncd_pio_SerialCDF, ncd_pio_DebugLevel, and ncd_pio_num_iotasks
        These options are NOT currently tested or functional. See the pio configure mode above.
  fine-mesh namelist options: 
  casa namelist options: lnpp, lalloc, q10, spunup, and fcpool

        As above CASA is NOT scientifically validated and hence we don't recommend using it, thus we don't
        recommend using the casa namelist options (they are only available when running with CASA).

See KnownBugs/KnownLimitations files for Known Problems:

    See the KnownBugs file in this directory for the list of known problems. We expect
    that eventually we will fix the bugs in this list. In the KnownLimitations file
    we list limitations in the code that we have workarounds for that we do NOT expect
    to fix.
