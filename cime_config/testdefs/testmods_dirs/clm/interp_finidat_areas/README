This testmod is designed to test init_interp_method='use_finidat_areas'.

This should be used in an LII test. So it must be used in a
configuration for which we have a compatible out-of-the-box finidat file
(so that the run with use_init_interp = .false. runs successfully). In
constrast to our standard LII test (which uses glcMEC_spunup_1way), this
one can use a standard CISM2%NOEVOLVE configuration: we do *not* need to
set GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING=FALSE; in fact, it's a better test if we have
GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING=TRUE: with this mode of operation, areas should
match between the two runs.

It may not be totally necessary to have a system test covering this
init_interp_method: between unit tests and inline checks, we have quite
a bit of testing of this code. It's important to have at least one LII
test to make sure we're interpolating all the fields we're supposed to
interpolate, but we don't necessarily need a LII test with this mode of
operation as long as we have one with the general mode of operation.

However, this test is a good check that every point has a unique type
(because this mode of operation will fail if that's not the case); this
is something needed even for the 'general' init_interp method to work
correctly, but the 'general' mode won't catch problems in this regard.

One other reason why this test is useful is to cover the threading
directives in the set_single_match routine, since those aren't covered
by unit tests. So this test mod should be used in an LII test with
threading.

To update the initial conditions (finidat) file for this test:

(1) Run the LII test; the 'base' case should run to completion even if the
no_interp test fails. (If the 'base' case fails, you may need to retry
with init_interp_method='general'.)

(2) Copy the finidat_interp_dest.nc file from the 'base' case to the inputdata
space. Rename this to be similar to the out-of-the-box finidat file
currently used by this test, but with a new creation date.

(3) Update namelist defaults to point to the new finidat file. If
updating the out-of-the-box file is not desired, then you could instead
point to this new finidat file with a user_nl_clm file in this testmod.
