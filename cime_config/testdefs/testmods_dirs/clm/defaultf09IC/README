This testmods directory is for running LII tests which compare the answers for a case where
initial condition interpolation is on (use_init_interp=T) to a case with it's off and ensures
they are exact. For that to be, it needs to be a case that essentially needs no interpolation
so it's at the same resolution as the initial condition file (finidat file). When surface
datasets are changed, or the land-mask is changed, or an imporant change is made to model
physics (for example where new fields are added to the restart file) -- you'll need to update
the initial conditions file in this test (finidat file in the user_nl_clm file). 

To do that run an SMS test that correpsonds to the LII test and copy the resulting interpolated
initial conditions (the "finidat_interp_dest.nc" file) to an updated name with an updated
creation date akin to the location of the current finidat file. Then update the finidat
file pointed to here to that file. The intention is to have both the LII and SMS tests
in the standard test list. At some point we may have a better test that does both of these
at once, all the time, but until then this is the process.

Update finidat file for the LII test of this case:

1.) Run SMS test at same resolution with this testmods directory.

2.) Copy finidat_interp_dest.nc file to new filename in inputdata with updated name/creation date.

3.) Update user_nl_clm in this directory to point to the file in step 2.
