! This file provides partially-spun-up initial conditions for glc_mec.
! However, it is by no means entirely spun up, and should not be used for production runs.
! Note that this was generated with GLC_TWO_WAY_COUPLING=FALSE
! Initial condition file at the desired configuration to run, so can verify that interpolating from it gives the same result
finidat = '$DIN_LOC_ROOT/lnd/clm2/initdata_map/clmi.IG1850CLM45SP.1850-01-01.1.9x2.5_gx1v7_gl4_simyr1850_c170608.nc'
! Set interpolation to true here so that an SMS test of this test mods directory can be used to regen the above initial conditions
! copy the finidat_interp_dest.nc from the SMS case into the above filename with an updated creation date.
use_init_interp = .true.
! Note the LII test will override this setting of use_init_interp as part of what it does, but we want to explicitly
! set it here so that an SMS test will give us the initial conditions we need.
